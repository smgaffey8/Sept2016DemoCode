# Authentication
> We use authentication to protect areas of websites from unauthorized access.

Essentially, a good first-party authentication strategy will use some form of encryption and hashing technique in order to protect users of a service.

First-Party Auth: YOUR SRVER. You are handling the auth.

### Hashing
- Hashing protects plain-text values
- Hashing is a ONE WAY THING.
- Mathematically, the algorithm that hashes a plain text value is impossible to reverse.

### Encoding / Decoding
- `%20` => Space (example of an encoded value)
- Encoding is the idea of representing information in a TWO WAY relationship.
- In the web world, the most common reasons why we do this is because we often have to work with restrictions, like for instance restricted characters in a URL.

- Example : `?q=This%20awesome%20sentence`

### Client sessions
- awesome npm module for encrypted cookies
- has a built-in cookie parser that knows how to decrypt cookies
- is developed by Mozilla
- is awesome

## Steps to adding Auth to your app
1. Add a `User` model
2. Add a `POST` route to create a user [register]. (good time to test creation with POSTMAN)
3. Add a `POST` route to authenticate a `User` [login].
4. Add middleware to protect the areas of your site/app that require a login to access.
